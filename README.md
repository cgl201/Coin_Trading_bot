# Coin_Trading_bot
The code is based on Python3

This is a sample version of trading bot program for Bitfinex and Okex, but it has completed functions for your use, including back-testing, scraping data, evaluating performance, automatically sending email, etc..

I remained a simple algorithm, bollinger bands,  for your test.

If you want to use this bot, you need to apply for an API account, and add your API key into the main.py.

If you'd like to use the email function, you should know your email SMTP and port. This program can only use qq-mail, if you do not want to change it.

Feel free to develop your own strat based on my bot, and define it as a function in Signals.py.
