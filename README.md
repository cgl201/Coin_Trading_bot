# Coin_Trading_bot
This is a sample version of trading bot program for Bitfinex and Okex, but it has completed function for your use, including back-testing, scraping data, evaluating performance, automatically sending email, etc..

I remained a simple algorithm, bollinger bands,  for your test.
You can develop your own strat in the signal.py based on my system. 

If you want to use this bot, you need to apply an API account, and add your API key into the main code.

If you'd like to use the email function, you should know your email server
